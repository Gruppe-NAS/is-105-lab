16.4)	Appearently, Zed Shaw, the writer of the book wants us to pay attention to detail. To write target.truncate() after writing 'w' in the target = open(filename, 'w') is just pointless. The reason being that the 'w' already initiates the write() command, thus making the truncate() command useless.

16.5)	It is not needed, as we have already opened the file in write mode.
