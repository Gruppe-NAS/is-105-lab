5.5)	I think that using the argv method is better to get a filename than the raw_input() method. The 	reason to this is that the argv method is faster and requires less typing/keypressing.

5.6)	readline(): Reads just one line of a text file.

	readlines(): Reads every line in the .txt file. Puts each line into square brackets and includes 		everything. If there is a linebrake, the linebreak is read as \n.

	tell(): Tells us the file position. In our case, it returns 0.

	close(): Closes the file.

	read(): Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.

	truncate(): Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.

	write(stuff): Writes stuff to the file.
