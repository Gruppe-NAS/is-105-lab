	- Import (Python): Import is used to import different libraries in Python. For example the sys library.

	- "script"-language: Is a programming language that supports scripts. An example of this might be the 			command line in windows, or terminal in linux/ios. By typing a set of commands, the program interprets them and returns a result relative to what has been typed.

	- Perl: Is a programming language developed by Larry Wall. It was originally created as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.

	- Bash: Is a Unix shell. It is used the same way as the command line in windows, namely to run command scripts and open files.
